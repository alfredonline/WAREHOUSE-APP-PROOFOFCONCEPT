      Images are programatically generated. An image will only be returned if it
      exists in the database. There are 5 entries you can search for. An image
      is generated upon request provided that it exists as previously mentioned,
      then it is stored in the output folder and by default will be deleted
      after two minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      SEARCHING FOR A BOX NUMBER NOT LISTED IN THE LIST BELOW WILL NOT WORK. THE
      IMAGE IS ONLY GENERATED WHEN THE BOX INFO IS STORED IN SQL.
